# Java-data-structures
## Introduction/summary
This repository contains code written to illustrate the use of various data structures and implementations of various algorithms.
Some of the data structures include:
- Arrays
- 2D Arrays
- Dynamic Arrays
- LinkedLists
- Queues
- Priority queues
- Hash tables
- Stacks

The algorithms covered include:
- sorting algorithms
    - Bubble sort
    - quick sort
    - merge sort
    - insertion sort
    - selection sort
- searching algorithms
    - interpolation search
    - binary search
    - linear search

I've also included some code and implementations on non-linear data structures such as:
- adjacency lists
- adjacency matrices
- binary search trees
- breadth first search
- depth first search
## Usage
To use the codes in this repo in your computer, you'll need to clone this repository and move inside it.
You can use the following shell/terminal commands:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/SymonMuchemi/Java-data-structures.git
cd Java-data-structures
```
